# Emotion Detection in Images and Music Pairing Through AI

## 🎵 Emotion-Based Music Recommendation Using Computer Vision
This project explores the intersection of computer vision and AI-driven creativity by developing models that detect emotions in facial expressions and landscapes. Based on the identified emotion, the system recommends a musical playlist that aligns with the mood of the image.

## 🔍 Project Overview
Goal: Build a model capable of analyzing images and recommending music based on detected emotions. <br> 
Datasets: Facial expression dataset (5 emotions) and landscape dataset (4 emotions). <br> 
### Models Used:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) <br> 
CNNs combined with Support Vector Machines (CNN + SVM) <br> 
Baseline and fine-tuned models with grid search optimization <br> 
### Results:
Best-performing model: Fine-tuned CNN <br> 
Accuracy: 60% (Facial expressions), 55% (Landscapes) <br> 
Insights: Emotion recognition in landscapes remains an open challenge, presenting opportunities for future research. <br> 
### 🚀 Key Contributions
✔️ Development of an AI-driven music recommendation system. <br> 
✔️ Analysis of emotion detection in non-human subjects (landscapes). <br> 
✔️ Fine-tuning of CNN-based architectures for improved performance. <br> 

### 📌 Future Work
🔹 Enhance model performance with larger datasets and advanced architectures. <br> 
🔹 Investigate the impact of multi-modal inputs (e.g., text, audio). <br> 
🔹 Explore transfer learning to refine emotion detection in landscapes. <br>
