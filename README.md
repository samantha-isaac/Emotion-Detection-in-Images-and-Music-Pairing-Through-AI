# Emotion-Detection-in-Images-and-Music-Pairing-Through-AI
This project uses computer vision to detect emotions in faces and landscapes, recommending a music playlist based on the detected mood. It explores CNN and CNN+SVM models, with fine-tuned CNNs achieving the best results (60% for faces, 55% for landscapes). The study highlights challenges in emotion detection for landscapes.
