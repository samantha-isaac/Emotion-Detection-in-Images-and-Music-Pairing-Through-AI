# Emotion Detection in Images and Music Pairing Through AI

##🎵 Emotion-Based Music Recommendation Using Computer Vision
This project explores the intersection of computer vision and AI-driven creativity by developing models that detect emotions in facial expressions and landscapes. Based on the identified emotion, the system recommends a musical playlist that aligns with the mood of the image.

##🔍 Project Overview
Goal: Build a model capable of analyzing images and recommending music based on detected emotions.
Datasets: Facial expression dataset (5 emotions) and landscape dataset (4 emotions).
###Models Used:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs combined with Support Vector Machines (CNN + SVM)
Baseline and fine-tuned models with grid search optimization
###Results:
Best-performing model: Fine-tuned CNN
Accuracy: 60% (Facial expressions), 55% (Landscapes)
Insights: Emotion recognition in landscapes remains an open challenge, presenting opportunities for future research.
###🚀 Key Contributions
✔️ Development of an AI-driven music recommendation system.
✔️ Analysis of emotion detection in non-human subjects (landscapes).
✔️ Fine-tuning of CNN-based architectures for improved performance.

###📌 Future Work
🔹 Enhance model performance with larger datasets and advanced architectures.
🔹 Investigate the impact of multi-modal inputs (e.g., text, audio).
🔹 Explore transfer learning to refine emotion detection in landscapes.
